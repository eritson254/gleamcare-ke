Most people do not need a 10-step routine. A consistent 4-step routine usually gives better results than a complicated routine you cannot maintain.

## The 4 steps

### 1. Cleanse
Use a gentle cleanser that removes dirt and sunscreen without stripping your skin.

### 2. Treat
Pick one treatment based on your goal:

- Dullness: vitamin C
- Breakouts: salicylic acid
- Uneven tone: niacinamide
- Fine lines: retinoid (start slowly)

### 3. Moisturize
A moisturizer helps maintain your skin barrier and reduces irritation from active ingredients.

### 4. Protect (morning only)
Daily sunscreen is non-negotiable. Use broad-spectrum SPF 30+ every morning.

## Keep it realistic

- Start with a small routine and upgrade later.
- Introduce one new active at a time.
- Give each routine at least 4 to 8 weeks before changing everything.

Consistency beats complexity.
