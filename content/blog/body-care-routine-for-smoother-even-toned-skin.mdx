Good body care is about consistency, not complicated routines. A few steady steps can improve texture and tone over time.

## Core routine

### 1. Cleanse gently
Use a non-stripping body cleanser, especially if your skin feels tight after showers.

### 2. Exfoliate 1 to 2 times weekly
Use a gentle body exfoliator to smooth rough areas like elbows and knees.

### 3. Moisturize daily
Apply body lotion on slightly damp skin to lock in hydration.

### 4. Protect exposed areas
Use sunscreen on neck, chest, and arms during daytime exposure.

## Targeting uneven tone

- Avoid harsh scrubbing
- Keep skin hydrated every day
- Be consistent with sun protection

## Results timeline

Most people notice softer skin in 1 to 2 weeks and more even texture in 4 to 8 weeks with regular care.
