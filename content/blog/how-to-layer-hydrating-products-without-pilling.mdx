Pilling usually happens when product texture, layering order, or wait time is off. The fix is usually technique, not buying more products.

## Why pilling happens

- Applying too much product in one step
- Layering silicone-heavy products too quickly
- Rubbing instead of pressing products in
- Using incompatible formulas back-to-back

## A low-pilling hydration order

### 1. Cleanser
Start with a gentle cleanse so products can sit evenly on skin.

### 2. Watery toner
Use a thin hydrating toner first and pat it in.

### 3. Hydrating serum
Apply 1 to 2 pumps, then press lightly.

### 4. Moisturizer
Seal hydration with a cream or gel-cream.

### 5. Sunscreen (morning)
Apply sunscreen as the final skincare step.

## Technique tips that matter

- Use thin layers.
- Wait 30 to 60 seconds between layers.
- Press products into skin rather than rubbing hard.
- Let skincare set before makeup.

Small adjustments in order and application usually stop pilling within a few days.
