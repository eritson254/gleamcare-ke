Acne-prone skin often gets worse when routines become too harsh. The goal is balance, not maximum strength.

## Focus areas

- Gentle cleansing
- One targeted acne treatment
- Consistent hydration
- Daily sunscreen

## A simple starting routine

### Morning

- Gentle cleanser
- Lightweight moisturizer
- Sunscreen

### Evening

- Gentle cleanser
- Salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide (not both at once initially)
- Moisturizer

## What to avoid

- Multiple new actives at the same time
- Strong exfoliation every day
- Skipping moisturizer because of oily skin

Barrier health is critical for acne recovery.
