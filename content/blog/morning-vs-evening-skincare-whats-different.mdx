Morning and evening routines should not be identical. Your skin needs different support at different times.

## Morning routine goal

Protect your skin.

Recommended structure:

- Cleanser (or rinse if your skin is dry)
- Lightweight treatment (optional)
- Moisturizer
- Sunscreen SPF 30+

## Evening routine goal

Cleanse deeply and repair.

Recommended structure:

- Cleanser (double cleanse if you wore makeup/sunscreen)
- Treatment (retinoid, exfoliant, or targeted serum)
- Moisturizer

## Quick rule

If your skin feels irritated, simplify:

- Remove extra actives
- Focus on cleanser, moisturizer, sunscreen
- Reintroduce treatments slowly
