Retinol works best with consistency and patience. Starting too strong usually causes irritation and makes people quit early.

## Starter schedule

Use retinol at night, 2 times per week for the first 2 weeks.

- Week 1 to 2: 2 nights per week
- Week 3 to 4: every other night if comfortable
- After week 4: increase only if skin remains calm

## How to apply

1. Cleanse and dry skin fully.
2. Apply a small amount of retinol.
3. Follow with a barrier-supporting moisturizer.

If your skin is sensitive, apply moisturizer first, then retinol, then another thin layer of moisturizer.

## What to avoid at first

- Strong exfoliating acids on the same night
- Daily use too early
- Skipping moisturizer

## Morning rule

Wear sunscreen every morning when using retinol. This is essential for comfort and results.

Retinol progress is gradual, but steady use with low irritation gives the best long-term outcome.
