Niacinamide (vitamin B3) is popular because it supports several skin goals at once.

## Benefits

- Helps regulate oil
- Supports barrier function
- Improves uneven tone
- Reduces the appearance of enlarged pores

## Who should use it?

Niacinamide works for most skin types, including oily, acne-prone, and sensitive skin.

## How to layer it

Use niacinamide after cleansing and before moisturizer. If you are using a watery toner, apply toner first, then niacinamide serum.

## How often?

Start once daily for 1 to 2 weeks. If your skin is comfortable, move to twice daily.

## Common mistake

Using too many strong actives in one routine. Keep your routine simple and avoid stacking many new ingredients at once.
