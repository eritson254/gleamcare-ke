## Full description

This is for the days your skin needs comfort and bounce. Hyaluronic acid helps skin feel **more hydrated and smoother**, especially when used consistently as your daily moisturizer.

### How it fits

Use it after serums and before SPF in the morning. At night, use it as your final step or layer it with a richer cream if you’re extra dry.

## How to use

1. Apply to slightly damp skin after cleansing/serums.
2. Smooth a thin layer over face and neck.
3. In the morning, finish with sunscreen.

**Pro tip:** Hyaluronic acid works best when you lock it in—apply on damp skin and seal with moisturizer.
