### What it does

This toner helps refresh the skin after cleansing while improving the look of uneven texture. It prepares your skin to better absorb serums and moisturizers that follow.

### How it fits in your routine

- **Cleanse → Treat (this toner) → Treat (serum/ampoule) → Moisturize → Protect (AM)**
- If your skin is sensitive, start with once daily and increase gradually.

### Quick tips

- Apply with hands for a gentler application.
- Avoid over-layering if your routine already includes exfoliating treatments.

## How to use

1. Cleanse your face thoroughly.
2. Dispense a small amount onto palms or a cotton pad.
3. Gently sweep or pat over the face.
4. Follow with serum or ampoule.
5. Finish with moisturizer (and sunscreen in the morning).

**Patch test first**, especially if you are new to exfoliating toners.
