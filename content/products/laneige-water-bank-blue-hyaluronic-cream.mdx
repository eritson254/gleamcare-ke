### What it does

This cream helps replenish moisture and maintain a smooth, comfortable skin feel. It works well as your final moisturizing step before sunscreen in the morning or as your nighttime cream.

### How it fits in your routine

- **Cleanse → Treat → Moisturize (this cream) → Protect (AM sunscreen)**
- Adjust the amount based on your skin’s hydration needs.

### Quick tips

- Apply while skin is slightly damp to help lock in moisture.
- Use a thicker layer at night if your skin feels extra dry.

## How to use

1. After serum, take a small amount.
2. Spread evenly across the face.
3. Gently press until fully absorbed.
4. In the morning, follow with sunscreen.

Patch test first if your skin is sensitive.
