### What it does

This lotion helps lock in moisture after treatment steps while maintaining a lightweight, breathable finish on the skin.

### How it fits in your routine

- **Cleanse → Treat → Moisturize (this lotion) → Protect (AM sunscreen)**
- Can be layered under a richer cream if needed.

### Quick tips

- Apply evenly across the face and neck.
- Use a thicker layer at night if skin feels dry.

## How to use

1. After serum, apply a small amount to the face.
2. Gently press until absorbed.
3. In the morning, follow with sunscreen.

Patch test first if your skin is sensitive.
