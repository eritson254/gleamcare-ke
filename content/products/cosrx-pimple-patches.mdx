## Full description

These are your quick, easy go-to for blemish days. They help **cover the spot**, protect it from dust and touching, and support a cleaner-looking healing process.

### When you’ll reach for them

- A visible pimple that needs protection
- Overnight care
- Days you want to avoid picking

### What it feels like

Thin, comfortable, and stays on well—especially when applied to clean, dry skin.

## How to use

1. Cleanse and dry the area completely.
2. Apply a patch directly on the blemish.
3. Leave for several hours or overnight.
4. Replace when the patch turns opaque/white.

**Pro tip:** Don’t apply skincare directly under the patch—use it on clean, dry skin for best grip.
