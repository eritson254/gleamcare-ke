## Full description

Turmeric is a popular routine staple for people who want a fresher, brighter-looking body care routine. This soap is best used consistently, followed by moisturizing and—if used on exposed areas—SPF.

## How to use

1. Lather on wet skin (hands, cloth, or sponge).
2. Cleanse gently and rinse thoroughly.
3. Follow with moisturizer. Use SPF on exposed areas in the daytime.

**Pro tip:** If using on the face, start slow (2–3x weekly) and patch test first.
