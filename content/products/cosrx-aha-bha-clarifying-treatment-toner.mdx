### What it does

This toner helps gently exfoliate the skin’s surface to improve the look of texture and congestion. It supports smoother-looking skin when used consistently and gradually.

### How it fits in your routine

- **Cleanse → Treat (this toner) → Serum → Moisturize**
- Use sunscreen daily if incorporating exfoliating products into your routine.

### Quick tips

- Start 2–3 times per week and adjust based on tolerance.
- Avoid layering with other strong exfoliating treatments.

## How to use

1. Cleanse your skin.
2. Apply to a cotton pad and sweep gently over the face.
3. Follow with serum and moisturizer.
4. In the morning, always apply sunscreen.

Patch test first, especially if your skin is sensitive.
