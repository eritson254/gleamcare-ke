## Full description

This is for anyone who loves moisturizing body care that also leaves a soft scent behind. It’s an easy daily staple—especially right after showering.

## How to use

1. Apply to clean, dry skin after showering.
2. Focus on elbows, knees, and dry areas.
3. Layer with a matching body mist if desired.

**Pro tip:** Apply while skin is slightly damp to lock in moisture.
