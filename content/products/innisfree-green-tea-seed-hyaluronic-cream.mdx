### What it does

This cream helps seal in hydration and maintain a soft, comfortable skin feel. It works well as your daily moisturizer in both morning and evening routines.

### How it fits in your routine

- **Cleanse → Treat → Moisturize (this cream) → Protect (AM sunscreen)**
- Use a slightly thicker layer at night if your skin feels dry.

### Quick tips

- Apply while skin is slightly damp to lock in moisture.
- Adjust the amount depending on your skin’s needs.

## How to use

1. After serum, apply a small amount evenly across the face.
2. Gently press until absorbed.
3. In the morning, follow with sunscreen.

Patch test first if your skin is sensitive.
