### What it does

This cream helps seal in hydration after your treatment steps while supporting a smoother-looking complexion. It’s suitable for routines focused on managing congestion and maintaining balance.

### How it fits in your routine

- **Cleanse → Treat → Moisturize (this cream) → Protect (AM sunscreen)**
- Adjust the amount based on your skin’s needs.

### Quick tips

- Use a lighter layer during the day.
- Pair with sunscreen in the morning.
- Reduce frequency if your routine already includes multiple exfoliating steps.

## How to use

1. After serum, apply a small amount evenly across the face.
2. Gently press until absorbed.
3. In the morning, follow with sunscreen.

Patch test first, especially if your skin is sensitive.
