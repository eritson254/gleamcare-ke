## Full description

If you’re serious about glow and long-term skin health, SPF is non-negotiable. This sunscreen is a great everyday choice—**lightweight, comfortable, and easy to layer**.

### Why SPF matters

Daily sun exposure can lead to dullness, uneven tone, and early signs of aging. Adding SPF helps keep your skin looking smoother and more even over time.

### How it fits in your routine

Use it every morning as the final step after moisturizer. It works great for everyday wear—especially for Nairobi heat, errands, and commuting.

## How to use

1. Apply generously to face and neck as the last step of your morning routine.
2. Wait 10–15 minutes before going into direct sun.
3. Reapply every 2 hours when outdoors (or after sweating).

**Pro tip:** Use two-finger length of sunscreen for face + neck for proper coverage.
