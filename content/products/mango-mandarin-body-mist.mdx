## Full description

If you love a fresh, fruity scent that doesn’t feel heavy, this is a perfect everyday mist. It’s designed for **light wear** and easy reapplication.

## How to use

1. Spray on clean skin after showering.
2. Focus on pulse points (wrists, neck) and clothes if preferred.
3. Reapply as needed.

**Pro tip:** Layer with an unscented or matching lotion to make the scent last longer.
