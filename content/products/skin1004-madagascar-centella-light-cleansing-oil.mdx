### What it does

This cleansing oil works as your first cleanse, helping break down makeup, sunscreen, and excess oil before your regular foaming cleanser. It leaves skin feeling clean, not stripped.

### How it fits in your routine

- **PM: Oil Cleanse (this product) → Water-Based Cleanser → Treat → Moisturize**
- In the morning, you may skip oil cleansing unless needed.

### Quick tips

- Always apply to dry skin first.
- Add a little water to emulsify before rinsing.

## How to use

1. Apply 1–2 pumps to dry hands.
2. Massage gently over dry face.
3. Add a small amount of water to emulsify (it will turn milky).
4. Rinse thoroughly.
5. Follow with a water-based cleanser.

**Patch test first** if your skin is highly sensitive.
