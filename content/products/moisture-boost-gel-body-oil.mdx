## Full description

This is the “final step” that makes your skin look and feel finished. Use it after lotion to seal in moisture and add a soft glow.

## How to use

1. Apply lotion to damp or dry skin.
2. Add a small amount of gel/oil on top and massage in.
3. Focus on legs, arms, shoulders—where you want extra glow.

**Pro tip:** A little goes a long way. Start small and build up if needed.
