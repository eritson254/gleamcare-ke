### What it does

This eye cream helps hydrate and support a smoother-looking under-eye area. It’s designed to be gentle enough for daily use while fitting easily into most skincare routines.

### How it fits in your routine

- **Cleanse → Treat → Eye Cream (this product) → Moisturize → Protect (AM)**
- Apply before your main face moisturizer.

### Quick tips

- Use a rice-sized amount for both eyes.
- Gently tap—don’t rub—the product into the skin.

## How to use

1. After serum, apply a small amount to the under-eye area.
2. Gently tap with your ring finger until absorbed.
3. Follow with moisturizer.
4. In the morning, apply sunscreen to the rest of your face.

Patch test first if your skin is sensitive.
