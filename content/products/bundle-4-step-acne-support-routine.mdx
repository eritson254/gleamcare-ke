### What it does

This 4-step routine is designed to support clearer-looking skin by addressing excess oil, clogged pores, and visible irritation. It combines gentle exfoliation with calming support—without overwhelming the skin.

### How it fits in your routine

- **Cleanse → Tone → Treat (Serum) → Soothe (Ampoule) → Moisturize → Protect (AM sunscreen)**
- Start slowly if you are new to exfoliating ingredients.
- Always apply sunscreen in the morning.

### Quick tips

- Introduce gradually if your skin is sensitive.
- Avoid layering with other strong exfoliating products.
- Keep the rest of your routine simple while using this system.

## How to use

1. **Cleanser** — Use on damp skin, massage gently, and rinse.
2. **Toner** — Apply with hands or cotton pad and press in.
3. **Serum** — Apply a small amount and allow to absorb.
4. **Tea-Trica Ampoule** — Apply to the full face or target areas.
5. Follow with moisturizer.
6. **AM:** Always finish with sunscreen.

Consistency is key. Results come from steady, balanced use—not overuse.
