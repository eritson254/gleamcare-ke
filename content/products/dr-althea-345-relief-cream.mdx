### What it does

This cream helps soothe the look of irritation and supports a calmer, more balanced complexion. It works well as the final moisturizing step in both morning and evening routines.

### How it fits in your routine

- **Cleanse → Treat → Moisturize (this cream) → Protect (AM sunscreen)**
- Apply a slightly thicker layer at night if skin feels stressed.

### Quick tips

- Use after calming serums for best results.
- Keep routine simple if your skin feels reactive.

## How to use

1. After serum, apply a small amount evenly across the face.
2. Gently press into the skin until absorbed.
3. In the morning, follow with sunscreen.

Patch test first if your skin is sensitive.
