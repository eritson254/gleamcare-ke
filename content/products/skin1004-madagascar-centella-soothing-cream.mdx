### What it does

This soothing cream seals in hydration after your treatment steps while helping maintain a calm, balanced skin feel. It’s ideal for routines focused on reducing visible irritation and supporting the skin barrier.

### How it fits in your routine

- **Cleanse → Treat → Moisturize (this cream) → Protect (AM sunscreen)**
- Use as your final step at night and before sunscreen in the morning.

### Quick tips

- Apply a thin layer if you have combination skin.
- For drier areas, press in a slightly thicker layer.

## How to use

1. After serum or ampoule, take a small amount.
2. Spread evenly across the face.
3. Gently press into the skin until absorbed.
4. In the morning, follow with sunscreen.

**Patch test first** if your skin is highly sensitive.
