### What it does

This cream helps seal in moisture after your treatment steps and supports a smooth, plump-looking complexion.

### How it fits in your routine

- **Cleanse → Treat → Moisturize (this cream) → Protect (AM sunscreen)**
- Adjust the amount based on your skin’s hydration needs.

### Quick tips

- Apply while skin is slightly damp to lock in moisture.
- Use a thicker layer at night if needed.

## How to use

1. After serum, apply a small amount evenly across the face.
2. Gently press until absorbed.
3. In the morning, follow with sunscreen.

Patch test first if your skin is sensitive.
