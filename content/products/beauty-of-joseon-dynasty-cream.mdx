### What it does

This cream seals in hydration after your treatment steps and helps maintain a smooth, balanced skin feel. It’s ideal as your final step at night and before sunscreen in the morning.

### How it fits in your routine

- **Cleanse → Treat → Moisturize (this cream) → Protect (AM sunscreen)**
- Use a slightly thicker layer at night if your skin feels dry.

### Quick tips

- Apply while skin is slightly damp to lock in moisture.
- Adjust amount depending on your skin type.

## How to use

1. After serum, take a small amount.
2. Spread evenly across the face.
3. Gently press into the skin until absorbed.
4. In the morning, follow with sunscreen.

Patch test first if your skin is sensitive.
