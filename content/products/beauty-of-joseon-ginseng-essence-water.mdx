### What it does

This essence helps hydrate and prep the skin after cleansing, creating a smoother base for serums and moisturizers. It supports a refreshed, revitalized appearance without feeling heavy.

### How it fits in your routine

- **Cleanse → Treat (this essence) → Serum → Moisturize → Protect (AM)**
- Can be layered once or twice if your skin feels dehydrated.

### Quick tips

- Apply with hands and gently pat in.
- Use before thicker treatment products.

## How to use

1. Cleanse your skin.
2. Dispense a moderate amount into your palms.
3. Gently pat over the face until absorbed.
4. Follow with serum and moisturizer.
5. In the morning, finish with sunscreen.

Patch test first if your skin is sensitive.
