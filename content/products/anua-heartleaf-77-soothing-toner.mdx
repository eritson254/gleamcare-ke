### What it does

This toner helps refresh the skin after cleansing while supporting a calmer-looking complexion. It preps your skin for serums and moisturizers without feeling heavy.

### How it fits in your routine

- **Cleanse → Treat (this toner) → Serum/Ampoule → Moisturize → Protect (AM)**
- Can be layered if your skin needs extra hydration.

### Quick tips

- Apply with your hands for a gentler application.
- Store in a cool place if you prefer a refreshing feel.

## How to use

1. Cleanse your face thoroughly.
2. Dispense a moderate amount onto your palms or a cotton pad.
3. Gently pat or sweep over the face.
4. Follow with your treatment step and moisturizer.
5. In the morning, finish with sunscreen.

**Patch test first**, especially if your skin is highly reactive.
