### What it does

This eye cream helps replenish moisture around the eyes and supports a smoother-looking under-eye area. It fits seamlessly into daily routines.

### How it fits in your routine

- **Cleanse → Treat → Eye Cream (this product) → Moisturize → Protect (AM)**
- Apply before your main face cream.

### Quick tips

- Use a small, rice-sized amount for both eyes.
- Gently tap into the skin—avoid rubbing.

## How to use

1. After serum, apply a small amount to the under-eye area.
2. Gently tap with your ring finger until absorbed.
3. Follow with moisturizer.

Patch test first if your skin is sensitive.
