### What it does

This ampoule is best used as your “treatment” step—after cleansing (and toner if you use one)—to help soothe irritation and support a more balanced, comfortable skin feel.

### How it fits in your routine

- **Cleanse → Treat (this ampoule) → Moisturize → Protect (AM sunscreen)**
- Start slowly if your skin is reactive. Consistency matters more than using too much.

### Quick tips

- Apply to slightly damp skin for a smoother spread.
- If you’re using multiple treatment steps, layer **thinnest to thickest**.

## How to use

1. Cleanse your face and pat skin slightly damp.
2. Apply **2–4 drops** over the face (or target areas).
3. Gently press in until absorbed.
4. Follow with moisturizer.
5. In the morning, finish with sunscreen.

**Patch test first**, especially if your skin is sensitive.
