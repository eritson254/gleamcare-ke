### What it does

This cream helps seal in hydration after your treatment steps and supports a smoother, more balanced skin feel. It works well as the final step in your nighttime routine and before sunscreen in the morning.

### How it fits in your routine

- **Cleanse → Treat → Moisturize (this cream) → Protect (AM sunscreen)**
- Adjust the amount depending on your skin type.

### Quick tips

- Apply on slightly damp skin to help lock in moisture.
- Use a thicker layer at night if your skin feels dry.

## How to use

1. After serum or essence, take a small amount.
2. Spread evenly across the face.
3. Gently press until absorbed.
4. In the morning, follow with sunscreen.

Patch test first if your skin is sensitive.
