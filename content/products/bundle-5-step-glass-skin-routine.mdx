### What it does

This 5-step system focuses on layering hydration and glow-supporting ingredients to create a smoother, more radiant-looking complexion. With consistent use, skin appears brighter, fresher, and more refined.

### How it fits in your routine

**Morning**

- Cleanse → Tone → Essence → Serum → Moisturize → Sunscreen

**Night**

- Cleanse → Tone → Essence → Serum → Sleeping Mask

The sleeping mask replaces your regular night cream 2–3 times per week.

### Quick tips

- Apply each layer while skin is slightly damp.
- Press products in gently — avoid rubbing.
- Consistency is more important than using large amounts.
- Always wear sunscreen during the day.

## How to use

1. **Cleanser** — Massage onto damp skin and rinse.
2. **Toner** — Apply and gently press into skin.
3. **Essence** — Apply a small amount and press until absorbed.
4. **Serum** — Apply evenly across the face.
5. **AM:** Follow with moisturizer + sunscreen.
6. **PM:** Replace moisturizer with the Sleeping Mask (2–3 nights weekly).

Glow builds gradually through consistent layering.
