This gel cream helps replenish moisture while keeping the skin feeling fresh and balanced. It’s ideal for those who prefer a lighter texture without sacrificing hydration.

### How it fits in your routine

- Can be layered under sunscreen during the day or used alone in humid weather.

### Quick tips

- Apply on slightly damp skin for better hydration.
- Use a thicker layer at night if needed.

## How to use
