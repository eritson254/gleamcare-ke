### What it does

This emulsion helps replenish hydration without feeling heavy, making it ideal for lighter daily routines or as a moisturizing layer before sunscreen.

### How it fits in your routine

- **Cleanse → Treat → Emulsion (this product) → Sunscreen (AM)**
- Can be layered under a richer cream at night if needed.

### Quick tips

- Apply on slightly damp skin.
- Use alone in humid weather or layer in drier conditions.

## How to use

1. After serum, apply a small amount evenly across the face.
2. Gently press until absorbed.
3. In the morning, follow with sunscreen.
4. At night, layer under a cream if extra moisture is needed.

Patch test first if your skin is sensitive.
