### What it does

This ampoule fits into the **treatment** step of your routine to help improve the look of dullness and support a fresher, more even-looking complexion—without feeling heavy on sensitive skin.

### How it fits in your routine

- **Cleanse → Treat (this ampoule) → Moisturize → Protect (AM sunscreen)**
- If you use multiple treatment steps, layer **thinnest to thickest**.

### Quick tips

- Apply on slightly damp skin for smoother spread.
- For best results, use consistently and always wear sunscreen in the morning.

## How to use

1. Cleanse your face and pat skin slightly damp.
2. Apply **2–4 drops** over the face (or focus on dull areas).
3. Gently press in until absorbed.
4. Follow with moisturizer.
5. In the morning, finish with sunscreen.

**Patch test first**, especially if your skin is sensitive.
