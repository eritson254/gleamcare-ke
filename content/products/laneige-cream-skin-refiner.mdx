### What it does

This product works as a hydrating prep step after cleansing, helping soften and replenish the skin while reducing the need for multiple layers.

### How it fits in your routine

- **Cleanse → Treat (this product) → Serum (optional) → Moisturize → Protect (AM)**
- Can replace a traditional toner in dry or sensitive routines.

### Quick tips

- Apply with hands and gently pat into the skin.
- Layer twice if your skin feels extra dry.

## How to use

1. Cleanse your face.
2. Dispense an appropriate amount into your palms.
3. Gently pat across the face until absorbed.
4. Follow with serum or moisturizer if needed.
5. In the morning, finish with sunscreen.

Patch test first if your skin is sensitive.
