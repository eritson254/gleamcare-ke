## Full description

This is one of the most popular “routine upgrade” serums for a reason. It’s a simple way to support a clearer-looking routine, especially if you’re dealing with **oiliness, visible pores, or texture**.

### What it helps with

- Oily-looking skin through the day
- The appearance of pores
- Uneven texture (with consistent use)

### How to layer it

Apply after cleansing, then follow with moisturizer. In the morning, finish with sunscreen.

## How to use

1. Cleanse and pat skin dry.
2. Apply 2–3 drops to the face (avoid the eye area).
3. Follow with moisturizer.
4. In the morning, finish with sunscreen.

**Pro tip:** If you’re new to actives, use it once daily for a week, then increase if your skin is comfortable.
