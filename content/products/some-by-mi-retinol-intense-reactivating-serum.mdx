### What it does

This serum works as a nighttime treatment step to help improve the appearance of fine lines and uneven texture over time.

### How it fits in your routine

- **PM: Cleanse → Toner → Treat (this serum) → Moisturize**
- Always use sunscreen during the day when incorporating retinol products.

### Quick tips

- Start 2–3 times per week if new to retinol.
- Avoid combining with strong exfoliants in the same routine.
- Use a gentle moisturizer after application.

## How to use

1. Cleanse and tone your skin in the evening.
2. Apply a small amount evenly across the face.
3. Gently press until absorbed.
4. Follow with moisturizer.
5. Use sunscreen daily.

Patch test first, especially if you are new to retinol.
