### What it does

This cream helps lock in hydration after your treatment steps while maintaining a soft, balanced skin feel. It works well for both daytime and nighttime routines.

### How it fits in your routine

- **Cleanse → Treat → Moisturize (this cream) → Protect (AM sunscreen)**
- Apply a slightly thicker layer at night if your skin feels dry.

### Quick tips

- Use on slightly damp skin to help seal in moisture.
- Adjust the amount depending on your skin’s needs.

## How to use

1. After serum, apply a small amount evenly across the face.
2. Gently press until absorbed.
3. In the morning, follow with sunscreen.

Patch test first if your skin is sensitive.
